      <h2 class="tooltip">What even is Collide?</h2>
      <p class="body">Collide was a livestreaming platform where influential creators could produce premium content for their audience.
        Creators could monetized their content through livestreams, video-on-demand, and the ability to exchange calls and texts with fans.</p>
        <p class="body">Since joining the team, we have transitioned towards a simpler product model where Creators can upload photos, pre-recorded videos, and call and text with fans.</p>

        <h2 class="tooltip">Identifying Roadblocks Early On</h2>
        <p class="body">The architecture was derived from an existing website. Our team started to realize there were many technical inefficiency
          with the product's architecture, which made it difficult to implement certain features that were requested by the investors.</p>
        <p class="body">Creators and users were recognized as two different entities. Meaning, Creator accounts could not use the functions
          of user accounts and vise-versa. This proved to cause major problems in our development process.</p>

          <figcaption>Initial userflow when Collide launched</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="body">Other problems were also quite apparent at the early stages of the initial launch.
          Retention rate were low, onboarding new fans were slow,revenue stream was lackluster,
          <p class="body">Creators were not able to create accounts on their own. They were having difficulties creating and uploading new content. </p>
          <p class="body">Fans weren't presented with easily-consumable content.

      <div>
        <h2 class="tooltip">Big Picture Goals to Meet</h2>
        <p class="body">My team wanted to lay out the primary goals we wanted to achieve through this redesign. We set up two separate goals,
          respectively for Creators and fans. We wanted to enhance a fan's experience by improving:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Ease of consuming content</li>
          <li>Finding specific and/or brand new Creators</li>
          <li>Simplify Login/Sign Up flow</li>
          <li>A more intuitive and modern feeling product</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="body">For Creators, we wanted to improve:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Process to create Content as a Creator</li>
          <li>Easily Sign Up and onboard an account</li>
          <li>Connecting with fans more effeciently</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="tooltip">Early Explorations</h2>
        <p class="body"> Lorem Khaled Ipsum is a major key to success. Wraith talk. It’s on you how you want to live your life.
          Everyone has a choice. I pick my choice, squeaky clean. Life is what you make it, so let’s make it. The key to more success is to have a lot of pillows.

        <h2 class="tooltip">A New Home</h2>
        <p class="body">We introduced a Home Feed that showcases featured content so users would have constant content to explore and consume. We also implemented caveats in the home page to encourage users to exlplore other Creators to increase behavior.</p>
        <figure class="image-container-multiple">
          <img src="./images/collide/homescroll.gif" data-action="zoom">
        </figure>
        <p class="body">As we released the product to the public, we started noticing users would only use the product when a specific Creator
        they were following were online. The product was not initially built to market content, it was built to market Creators.</p>
