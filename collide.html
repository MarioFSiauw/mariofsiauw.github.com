        <p class="body">Collide is an entertainment startup located in Los Angeles. I was put in charge of redesigning our iOS app, while also creating a few web pages.

        <p class="tooltip">INITIAL RELEASE</p>
        <p class="body">Collide was a livestreaming platform where influencers could produce premium content for their audience. Creators monetized their content
          through a Gifting model and/or Pay-Per-View business model.</p>
        <p class="body">We also featured the ability for fans to <span style="color:#5b2f94;font-weight:bold;font-size:26px">Call or Text</span> Creators
          through Twilio. This feature was what separated us from livestreaming giants such as Twitch and YouTube.</p>

        </div>
        <div>
          <p class="body">The architecture was derived from an existing website that was built on PHP. The idea was to reskin the web page and develop
          a mobile product alongside.</p>

      <div>
        <p class="tooltip">A BIG ROAD BUMP</p>
        <p class="body">One of the biggest issues that we exposed and tackled early on in this redesign was retention rate. As we released the product to the public, we started noticing users would only use the product when a specific
        Creator they were following were online. In a sense, the product was not initially built to market content, it was built to market Creators.
