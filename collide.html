        <p class="body">Collide is an entertainment startup located in Los Angeles. I worked on the redesign of our iOS app.

        <p class="tooltip">What is Collide?</p>
        <p class="body">Collide was a livestreaming platform where influential creators could produce premium content for their audience. Creators monetized their content
          through a Gifting model and/or Pay-Per-View business model.</p>
        <p class="body">We also featured the ability for fans to Call or Text Creators through Twilio.
          Fans were given the ability to purchase a Creator's "phone number" and send text messages, exchange photos, or call them for a credits.</p>

        <div>
          <p class="body">The architecture was derived from an existing website that was built on PHP. The idea was to reskin the web page and develop
          a mobile product alongside. Due to the way the product was built, there were many problems and red paths in the user experience of Collide.</p>

          <p class="body">The previous platform was built primarily as a one-way creator-to-consumer product. Creators could not act as users,
            which mean they were not allowed to browse around the user-side experience.</p>

      <div>
        <p class="tooltip">Identifying Major Roadblocks</p>
        <p class="body">One of the biggest issues that we exposed and tackled early on in this redesign was retention rate. As we released the product to the public, we started noticing users would only use the product when a specific
        Creator they were following were online. In a sense, the product was not initially built to market content, it was built to market Creators.
