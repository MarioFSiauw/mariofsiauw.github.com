      <h2 class="tooltip">Brief <span style="font-weight:400;font-size:20px;">(or Boxer)</span></h2>
      <p class="body">Collide was a livestreaming platform where influential creators could produce premium content for their audience.
        Creators could monetized their content through livestreams, video-on-demand, and the ability to exchange calls and texts with fans.</p>
        <p class="body">Since joining the team, we have transitioned towards a simpler product model where Creators can upload photos, pre-recorded videos, and call and text with fans.</p>

        <h2 class="tooltip">Identifying Roadblocks Early</h2>
        <p class="body">The MVP was derived from an existing website. Our team started to realize the product's architecture had accrued significant tech debt,
          which made it difficult to implement certain features that were requested by the investors.</p>
        <p class="body">Creators and users were recognized as two different entities. Meaning, Creator accounts could not use the functions
          of user accounts and vise-versa. This proved to cause major problems in our development process.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/collide/1.0userflowfinal.png">
          <figcaption>Initial userflow when Collide launched</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="body">Other problems were also quite apparent at the early stages of the initial launch.
          Retention rate were low, onboarding new fans were slow,revenue stream was lackluster, Creators were not able to create accounts on their own.
          They were having difficulties creating and uploading new content. Fans weren't presented with easily-consumable content.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 class="tooltip">Setting Up the Big Picture</h2>
        <p class="body">Before getting started on designing any screens, we wanted to lay out the primary goals we wanted to achieve through this redesign first.
          It was important to conserve our resources and thoroughly discuss the problems and try to find the right way to execute the answers early on.</p>
        <p class="body">We started off by deciding to set up two separate goals, respectively for Creators and fans. We wanted to enhance a fan's experience by improving:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Ease of consuming content</li>
          <li>Finding specific and/or brand new Creators</li>
          <li>Simplify Login/Sign Up flow</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="body">For Creators, we wanted to improve:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Process to create Content as a Creator</li>
          <li>Easily Sign Up and onboard an account</li>
          <li>Connecting with fans more effeciently</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="body">We then started to explore how to curate user journeys. By referencing the MVP, we could easily determine which paths needed to be fixed.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 class="tooltip">Early Explorations</h2>
        <p class="body">I began going through the App and figuring out user flows, setting objectives on what to achieve as a user, finding out the red paths and other unnecessary steps users are taking.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/collide/whiteboard2.0.png">
        </figure>
        <p class="body">Once we have figured out the optimal process to take, I started creating some wireframes to idealize Collides new style. I delivered several styles that I believed were an improvement,
          both visually and experiences, until our team was ready to onboard with one.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/collide/initialexploration.png">
          <figcaption>Early Wireframes Ideas</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="body">Based on the feedback that was given, I would try to iterate the designs on a weekly basis before we moved forward with the process.</p>
        <p class="body"></p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 class="tooltip">Our Visual Outcome</h2>
        <p class="body">Once we have finalized the screens, I proceeded to work together with our developers in order to establish the product as closely to the vision as possible.
        We decided on taking advantage of Zeplin in order to properly manage file handoff's with devs.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/collide/finalscreens.png">
        </figure>
        <p class="body">One of my personal goals for this project was to produce designs that other designers could easily understand and make changes without having to go through
          the ordeal of creating everything from scratch.</p>
          <p class="body">I organized our Sketch assets in components through the principles of the Atomic Design system. We were making good use of Storyboards, and there were talks of wanting to rebuild our web app with React.
          I felt that it was a perfect opportunity to start a holistic system between designers and developers.</p>

      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 class="tooltip">A New Home</h2>
        <p class="body">We introduced a Home Feed that showcases featured content so users would have ease of access to the content their Creators created. We also implemented caveats
          in the home page to encourage users to exlplore other Creators to increase behavior.</p>
        <figure class="image-container-multiple">
          <img src="./images/collide/homescroll.gif">
        </figure>
        <p class="body">The reason we believe the Home Feed is effective is because it drives engagement. I noticed users would previously only use the product when a specific Creator
        they were following were online. The product was not initially built to market content, it was built to market Creators. By providing affordances to explore other Creators and content, Collide is able to drive a bigger engagement with their users.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 class="tooltip">Intuitive Creator Hub</h2>
        <p class="body">We received feedback that Creators were having a hard time figuring out how to create content.
          The marketing team would have to personally explain to them how to navigate through the Creator functions.</p>
          <p class="body">By implementing a static "create" button Creators can easily upload videos, images, make calls and texts anytime.
        <figure class="image-container-multiple">
          <img src="./images/collide/creatorhub.gif">
        </figure>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 class="tooltip">Introducing Reveal</h2>
        <p class="body">Reveal is a completely new feature that's included in the redesign. It's primary function is for Creators to provide super-exclusive content to their fans.
        We wanted to enhance the community between Creators and their fans.</p>
        <figure class="image-container-multiple">
          <img src="./images/collide/revealuser.gif">
        </figure>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 class="tooltip">Seeing Increased Behavior</h2>
        <p class="body">Within a month's time of the new redesign implementation, we were able to see some drastic improvements in engagement.
        There was a spike in registration of new users, users were spending more time in the app, and they were sending more messages with creators.  </p>

      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 class="tooltip">Realistic Future Plans</h2>
        <p class="body">There are still a few new things we have planned to get shipped in the near future, updates to the Explore page and user sign up/log ins.
      These features will hopefully project a higher conversion rate with new downloads and further improve engagement with the users.</p>
      <p class="body">Improvements are also being made throughout the whole product on a daily basis.</p>
