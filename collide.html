        <p class="body">Collide was a livestreaming platform where influential creators could produce premium content for their audience.
          Creators could monetized their content through livestreams, video-on-demand, and the ability to exchange calls and texts with fans.</p>

          <p class="body">The product was already in development when I first got my hands on it. I was asked to assist
          the continuation of the existing designs and to provide whatever assets were needed, while surveying the user flows and
          overall experience of the app.</p>
          <p class="body">I found out that the architecture was derived from an existing website. The investors wanted to reskin the web page and develop
          a mobile product alongside. Our team started to realize there were many technical inefficiency with the product's architecture, which made it
        difficult to implement certain features that were requested by the investors.</p>

        <p class="tooltip">Identifying Major Roadblocks</p>
        <p class="body">Due to the way the product was built, there were many problems and red paths in the user experience of Collide.
        <p class="body">One of the biggest issues that we exposed and tackled early on in this redesign was retention rate.
        As we released the product to the public, we started noticing users would only use the product when a specific Creator
        they were following were online. In a sense, the product was not initially built to market content, it was built to market Creators.</p>

          <figcaption>Userflow and design of Collide's initial launch</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="body">The previous platform was built primarily as a one-way creator-to-consumer product. Creators could not act as users,
            which mean they were not allowed to browse around the user-side experience.</p>
        <p class="body">Another problem we ran into was concerning what authorization abilities Creators had over their profile.
          As we dug deep into how the back-end system worked, we found out Creators were not given access to change their basic profile information.</p>
