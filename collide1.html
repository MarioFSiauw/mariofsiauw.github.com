        <h1 class="fw6 f3 red">Problem statement</h1>
        <p class="lh-copy measure f4 f3-ns">
          The number of successful creators were too low when compared to overall number of sign ups. Metrics showed most Creators dropped off early in the onboarding process. Specifically before we were able to acquire meaningful information from them.
        </p>

      <div class="measure f3 center mv5">
        <h1 class="fw6 f3 gold">Hypothesis</h1>
        <p class="lh-copy measure f4 f3-ns">
          Our onboarding process was too confusing for users.
        </p>
        <ul class="lh-copy measure">
          <li class="f5 f4-ns pv3"><span class="b">Creator Onboarding was too long, it was 12 steps</span> - Why was it 12 steps? Because we wanted Creators to complete their full profile before proceeding to create content.</li>
          <li class="f5 f4-ns pv3"><span class="b">The 3rd screen displayed a false sense of completion</span> - I provided several checkpoint drop-offs for Creators to skip parts of the onboarding and go directly to their dashboard. The mistake here was assuming Creators were knowledgable enough to finish the rest of the steps.</li>
          <li class="f5 f4-ns pv3"><span class="b">Creators were confused on what to do after completing onboarding</span> - We held several in-house testings where users were invited into the office and create a Creator account. We noticed several things; some users were mindlessly inputting information into the fields, users were also confused about what to do once they landed into their dashboard (similar to problem 2).</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="measure f3 center mv5">
        <h1 class="fw6 f3 green">Proposed solution</h1>
        <p class="lh-copy measure f4 f3-ns">
          We reorganized the information architecture of onboarding and request information at more appropriate times.
        </p>
        <ul class="lh-copy measure">
          <li class="f5 f4-ns pv3"><span class="b">We shortened the onboarding process to 3 screens</span> - We are only serving them required basic informations needed to create a profile. This would greatly help with fatigue.</li>
          <li class="f5 f4-ns pv3"><span class="b">We implemented the "Launch Checklist"</span> - A list of to-do items that are recommended to the Creator. All items displayed are critical to the user's potential to become successful.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <blockquote class="mh0 pr0 mv6">
        <p class="f2 f2-l fw1 mv0 tc dark-gray lh-title baskerville">
          We determined that the onboarding process should be divided into two parts, <span class="orange">account creation</span> and <span class="orange">account setup</span>.

      <div class="measure f3 center mv5">
          <h1 class="fw6 f3">Sign up</h1>
          <p class="lh-copy measure f4 f3-ns">
            We wanted this process to be as quick and simple as possible, while still meeting critical requirements. We only ask for information that is required for users to create an account on Collide. By doing so, we reduced the onboarding process down from 13 screens to 3.

          This is a fantasy piece. In order to bring this project to life it would need proper infrastructure binding with modern technologies used within 
          the majority of parking garages across the world. Parker could lead to substantial savings from not having to buy physical materials that are dispensed in parking garages.
