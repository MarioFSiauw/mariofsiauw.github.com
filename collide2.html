      <p class="lh-copy measure f4 f3-ns">
        Notifications are implemented to alert users of activity related to their account. They can be beneficial and irritating, thus must be curated with explicit intent and elegance. Users allowing notifications from a product is an act of trust, and we do not want to take that for granted. 
      </p>

              Good notifications are:
            </p>
            <ul class="lh-copy measure mv1">
                <li class="f6 pv2"><span class="b">Non-interfering</span> - Let users know that something important has happened and would be beneficial for the user to pay attention to.
                </li>
                <li class="f6 pv2"><span class="b">Contextual</span> - Notifications should be direct. Be explicit in letting the user know what has happened and whether they should actively interact with it or not.
                </li>
                <li class="f6 pv2"><span class="b">Manageable</span> - Give the users the ability to manage how and when these notifications occur.*

                <li class="f6 pv2"><span class="b">Disruptive</span> - Do not cause a false sense of urgency. Notifications should be served when the user is not in the progress of an activity.

                <li class="f6 pv2"><span class="b">Generic</span> - Unless necessary, information within notifications shouldn't be generic.

    <h1 class="fw6 f4 f3-ns gray">Problem</h1>
      <p class="lh-copy measure f4 f3-ns">
        Users weren't alerted of new activity to their account. Collide notifications are currently being served through direct SMS (twilio) and emails. These are problematic for many reasons. Twilio SMS notifications are costly and unsoliciated. They also enforces the user to an experience outside of Collide. As far as emails go, our metrics show most of our emails don't end up being opened.

  <div class="measure f3 center mv5">
    <h1 class="fw6 f4 f3-ns gray">Proposed solution</h1>
      <p class="lh-copy measure f4 f3-ns">
        Implement in-app notifications. It's no surprise a notification system is beneficial to a product and its users. What is surprising is how Collide has gone this long without one. This was one of my biggest goals to achieve during my time at Collide.

  <div class="measure f3 center mv5">
      <h1 class="fw6 f4 f3-ns gray">What makes sense for Collide</h1>
      <p class="lh-copy measure f4 f3-ns">
          By understanding the basic principles of notifications, <span class="b">Mixed Model</span> notifications works best for Collide. Collide's business model poses the need for a complex and diverse suite of features to fit business needs. Mixed Model notifications will easily scale with the product as it continues to grow.

      Let's break down how notifications will be built. Mixed Model notifications consist of a <span class="b">Source</span> and an <span class="b">Anchor</span>. One determines where the notification is coming from, while the other determines where it should be sent.

          <ul class="lh-copy measure mv1">
              <li class="f6 pv2"><span class="b">Profile</span> - Relating to the profile of a user. Change if bio, new followers/subscribers, etc..

              <li class="f6 pv2"><span class="b">Posts</span> - Relating to activity of a specific post. Comments, Likes, etc..

              <li class="f6 pv2"><span class="b">Connect</span> - Relating to any activity of the in-app messenger, video chat, and phone calls.

                    <li class="f6 pv2"><span class="b">Messenger</span> - All related activity around our in-app messenger will be directed directly to its own anchor.

      <h1 class="fw6 f4 f3-ns">Implementation</h1>
      <p class="lh-copy measure f4 f3-ns">
        There are two main things to focus on; creating the notifications and anchors, and getting user permission to subscribe to receive notifications.
      </p>
      <ul class="lh-copy measure v1">
        <li class="f5 pv2">
            Implement a custom banner that asks users to enable notifications. They can either allow (which will prompt browser permission prompt) or dismiss it.
        </li>
        <li class="f5 pv2">
            Ask users to allow notifications when the benefits are most obvious to them. (i.e. when a supporter requests a video chat from a creator, serve a message that says "Would you like to be notified when your video chat is ready?").
        </li>
      </ul>

  <div class="measure f3 center mv5">
    <h1 class="fw6 f4 f3-ns gray">Final thoughts</h1>
      <p class="lh-copy measure f4 f3-ns">
        There are several things to be concerned about the solution we have picked. One would be users not allowing permission for Collide to send them notifications. Which will defeat the whole purpose of notifications. 
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy measure f4 f3-ns">
          Another problem is not implementing a way for users to manage their notifications. This is a temporary hold for now and will be implemented once resources are available.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy measure f4 f3-ns">
        Overall, finally having a notifications will bring lots of positivities to Collide that will ultimately drive user success and engagement.
