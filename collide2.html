    <h1 class="fw6 f4 f3-ns gray">Understanding the intent</h1>
      <p class="lh-copy measure f4 f3-ns">
        Notifications are implemented to alert users of activity related to their account. They can be beneficial and irritating, thus must be curated with explicit intent and elegance. Users allowing notifications from a product is an act of trust, and we do not want to take that for granted.

              Good notifications are:
            </p>
            <ul class="lh-copy measure mv1">
                <li class="f6 pv2"><span class="b">Non-interfering</span> - Let users know that something important has happened and would be beneficial for the user to pay attention to.
                </li>
                <li class="f6 pv2"><span class="b">Contextual</span> - Notifications should be direct. Be explicit in letting the user know what has happened and whether they should actively interact with it or not.
                </li>
                <li class="f6 pv2"><span class="b">Manageable</span> - Give the users the ability to manage how and when these notifications occur.*

                <li class="f6 pv2"><span class="b">Disruptive</span> - Do not cause a false sense of urgency. Notifications should be served when the user is not in the progress of an activity.

                <li class="f6 pv2"><span class="b">Generic</span> - Unless necessary, information within notifications shouldn't be generic.

    <h1 class="fw6 f4 f3-ns gray">Problem</h1>
      <p class="lh-copy measure f4 f3-ns">
        Users weren't alerted of new activity to their account.
      </p>
      <ul class="lh-copy measure">
        <li class="f5 f4-ns pv3">Collide notifications are currently being served through direct SMS (twilio) and emails. These are problematic for many reasons. Twilio SMS notifications are costly and unsoliciated. They also enforces the user to an experience outside of Collide. As far as emails go, our metrics show most of our emails don't end up being opened. 
        </li>

  <div class="measure f3 center mv5">
    <h1 class="fw6 f4 f3-ns gray">Proposed solution</h1>
      <p class="lh-copy measure f4 f3-ns">
        Implement in-app Notifications that is based off of a mixed model anchor.
      </p>
        <ul class="lh-copy measure">
          <li class="f5 f4-ns pv3">A general anchor for notifications is greatly beneficial for a product like Collide, which will continue to add features on top of what is currently available.

  <div class="measure f3 center mv5">
    <h1 class="fw6 f4 f3-ns gray">What makes sense for Collide</h1>
      <p class="lh-copy measure f4 f3-ns">
        By understanding the basic principles of notifications I can tell <span class="b">Mixed Model</span> notifications works best for Collide. Collide's business model poses the need for a complex and diverse suite of features to fit business needs.

        We wanted this process to be as quick and simple as possible, while still meeting critical requirements. We only ask for information that is required for users to create an account on Collide. By doing so, we reduced the onboarding process down from 13 screens to 3.

        This is a fantasy piece. In order to bring this project to life it would need proper infrastructure binding with modern technologies used within 
        the majority of parking garages across the world. Parker could lead to substantial savings from not having to buy physical materials that are dispensed in parking garages.
