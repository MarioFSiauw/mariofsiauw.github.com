        <h1 class="fw6 f4 f3-ns gray">Problem statement</h1>
          <p class="lh-copy measure f4 f3-ns">
            The number of successful creators were too low when compared to the overall number of sign ups. Our metrics showed most Creators dropped off early on in the onboarding process- Specifically before we were able to acquire meaningful information from them.

      <div class="measure f3 center mv5">
          <h1 class="fw6 f4 f3-ns gray">Researching the issue</h1>
            <p class="lh-copy measure f4 f3-ns">
                I started by examining the current flow to identify possible pain points before collaborating with or customer support team to identify related issues. In-house user testing session were then held to evaluate how real users are interacting with the process and all concerns were noted.

          <h1 class="fw6 f4 f3-ns gray">Understanding the problem</h1>
          <p class="lh-copy measure f4 f3-ns">
            After gathering sufficient data to work with, I determined these specific pain points were hindering users from successfully finishing the task.
          </p>
        <ul class="lh-copy measure">
          <li class="f5 f4-ns pv3"><span class="b">The process is too long</span> - Our onboarding process consisted of 12 steps. The original reason for it being so extensive was because we wanted Creators to complete their full profile before proceeding to create content.</li>
          <li class="f5 f4-ns pv3"><span class="b">Users feel a false sense of completion</span> - There were several dropoff points letting users skip parts of the onboarding process. The mistake here was presuming Creators would take time to eventually finish the rest of the required information.</li>
          <li class="f5 f4-ns pv3"><span class="b">Creators were confused as to what to do next</span> - Users were unsure of their next steps once they are redirected to their dashboard.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1 class="fw6 f4 f3-ns gray">Planning out a solution</h1>
          <p class="lh-copy measure f4 f3-ns">
            I started by reorganizing the structure of the flow, removing steps that only distracted them from their goal. I wanted this process to be quick and simple so Creators would feel less fatigue.

                  I then introduced the <b>Launch Checklist</b>. This checklist served as a list of "to-do" items that were recommended to the Creator thus promoting autonomous behavior.

              Once the designs and documentation was completed, it is handed off to our developers alongside detailed requirements that were written out through Zenhub.

            <p class="lh-copy measure f4 f3-ns">
              Unfortunately one of the issues we face is the lack of analytical measurement practice. I will not be able to firmly dictate whether the new Creator onboarding process is proven to be successful or not until the appropriate trackers are implemented.

            My plan is to continously make the onboarding process as simple as possible. Once we have enough tracking data to study from, I will be making additional changes to further improve the flow.
