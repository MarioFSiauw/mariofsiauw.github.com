        <h1 class="fw6 f4 f3-ns gray">Problem statement</h1>
          <p class="lh-copy measure f4 f3-ns">
            The number of successful creators were too low when compared to the overall number of sign ups. Metrics showed most Creators dropped off early in the onboarding process-- Specifically before we were able to acquire meaningful information from them.

      <div class="measure f3 center mv5">
          <h1 class="fw6 f4 f3-ns gray">Researching the issue</h1>
            <p class="lh-copy measure f4 f3-ns">
                I started by going through the onboarding flow to identify possible pain points, worked with customer support to identify related issues, and conducted an in-house user testing session to see how real users are interacting with the process and identity their concerns.

            After sufficient data to work with, I determined these specific pain points are hindering users from successfully finishing the task.

        <ul class="lh-copy measure">
          <li class="f5 f4-ns pv3"><span class="b">The process is too long</span> - Our onboarding process consisted of 12 steps. The reason for it being so extensive is because we wanted Creators to complete their full profile before proceeding to create content.</li>
          <li class="f5 f4-ns pv3"><span class="b">Users feel a false sense of completion</span> - There are several dropoff points letting users skip parts of the onboarding process. The mistake here was presuming Creators would take time to eventually finish the rest of the required information.</li>
          <li class="f5 f4-ns pv3"><span class="b">Creators were confused as to what to do next</span> - Users were unsure of their next steps once they are redirected to their dashboard.</li>

            We reorganized the information architecture of onboarding and request information at more appropriate times.

            We wanted this process to be as quick and simple as possible, while still meeting critical requirements. We only ask for information that is required for users to create an account on Collide. By doing so, we reduced the onboarding process down from 13 screens to 3.

            Once the changes ship to production, we will validate whether the proposed solution has any positive effect on user fatigue. We will do that by observing the rate of not just sign up completion, but also completion of each step of the process.
