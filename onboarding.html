        <h1 class="fw6 f4 f3-ns gray">Problem statement</h1>
          <p class="lh-copy measure f4 f3-ns">
            The number of successful creators were too low when compared to overall number of sign ups. Metrics showed most Creators dropped off early in the onboarding process. Specifically before we were able to acquire meaningful information from them.
          </p>
      </div>

      <div class="measure f3 center mv5">
        <h1 class="fw6 f4 f3-ns gray">Hypothesis</h1>
          <p class="lh-copy measure f4 f3-ns">
            After sufficient research, we concluded that our onboarding process was too confusing for users. We focused on three pain points we wanted to improve:
          </p>
        <ul class="lh-copy measure">
          <li class="f5 f4-ns pv3"><span class="b">Shorten the onboarding process</span> - Our 12-step onboarding is extensive because we wanted Creators to complete their full profile before proceeding to create content.</li>
          <li class="f5 f4-ns pv3"><span class="b">The 3rd screen displayed a false sense of completion</span> - I provided several checkpoint drop-offs for Creators to skip parts of the onboarding and go directly to their dashboard. The mistake here was assuming Creators were knowledgable enough to finish the rest of the steps.</li>
          <li class="f5 f4-ns pv3"><span class="b">Creators were confused on what to do after completing onboarding</span> - We held several in-house testings where users were invited into the office and create a Creator account. We noticed several things; some users were mindlessly inputting information into the fields, users were also confused about what to do once they landed into their dashboard (similar to problem 2).</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="measure f3 center mv5">
        <h1 class="fw6 f4 f3-ns gray">Proposed solution</h1>
          <p class="lh-copy measure f4 f3-ns">
            We reorganized the information architecture of onboarding and request information at more appropriate times.
          </p>
            <ul class="lh-copy measure">
              <li class="f5 f4-ns pv3"><span class="b">We shortened the onboarding process to 3 screens</span> - We are only serving them required basic informations needed to create a profile. This would greatly help with fatigue.</li>
              <li class="f5 f4-ns pv3"><span class="b">We implemented the "Launch Checklist"</span> - A list of to-do items that are recommended to the Creator. All items displayed are critical to the user's potential to become successful.</li>
            </ul>
      </div>

          <p class="lh-copy measure f4 f3-ns">
            We wanted this process to be as quick and simple as possible, while still meeting critical requirements. We only ask for information that is required for users to create an account on Collide. By doing so, we reduced the onboarding process down from 13 screens to 3.

          <p class="lh-copy measure f4 f3-ns">
            We're confident these changes will improve the onboarding experience for new users. The revamped Creator sign up and the addition of a launch checklist will help negate user exhaustion.
